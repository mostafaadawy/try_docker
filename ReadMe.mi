# Docker Tutorial Windows 
- for running docker desktop we need to [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) wsl from microsoft to allow virtual environments
- [install](https://www.docker.com/) docker desktop contains all its dependencies 
- we should have account on docker just like github
- we use docker hub that contains our published repos
- [docker hub](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-hub/) is the worldâ€™s leading service for finding and sharing container images with your team and the Docker community 
- for testing we created new project folder and create main.py python file
- `docker images` shows current installed images 
- `docker ps` displays  running containers 
# Create Docker image from this docker project
- `docker build -t hello-docker` build docker image from docker file `-t` stands for `tag` that give the image tag name so it followed by the image name `hello-docker` and then `.` refers to this folder
- at that moment we get that error `failed to solve with frontend dockerfile.v0: failed to read dockerfile: open /var/lib/docker/tmp/buildkit-mount228675408/Dockerfile: no such file or directory` that is because we didnot create the docker file yet.
- the steps begins by creating `docker file` which is `blueprint for building docker image` then creating `docker image` which is `a template based that docker file read only for running the container` then the `docker container` which is an `application running process`.
